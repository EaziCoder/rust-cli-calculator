## Why This Project Exists
I built this CLI calculator to reinforce the Rust concepts I'm learning.
Instead of jumping into advanced frameworks, I wanted a practical project that touches:
- Input parsing
- Error handling
- Memory safety
- Clean architecture
- File persistence
- Real-world Rust patterns
